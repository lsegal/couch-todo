h1. Couch TODO

Written by Loren Segal in 2008. License is "steal-me".

h2. INSTALL

Put the index file in any directory in the couch www folder. I 
used @todo@

This page was written to run from the @/usr/local/share/couch/www@ 
directory, so you might want to as well. It uses the jquery support 
files as well as the stylesheet from the CouchDB utils apps, so if
you don't house the file there you'll need to copy the image, style,
and script directories from there.

h2. RUN

Start your couchdb server with @couchdb@, and navigate to (if you
put the file in the @todo@ subdirectory):

  http://localhost:5984/_utils/todo

It works? Yay!
